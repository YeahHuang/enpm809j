<h2>Branch - CISO and Head of Corporate Security</h2>


Branch is the over- cautious paranoid survivalist in Troll Village, who lives in fear of invasion from the Bergens. The only troll in the village who doesn't sing, dance, or hug, Branch lives a disgruntled existence, constantly trying to prepare for the worst. He's constantly flummoxed by the over- the- top positivity of the other Trolls - is he the only sane one in this crowd of exuberantly happy Trolls? He does not like the cloud.

<h2>Cloud Guy - Chief Architect</h2>
Cloud Guy has been hired to modernize the trollâ€™s IT infrastructure.  He wears socks with no shoes and likes high fives.  He also obviously likes the cloud.
